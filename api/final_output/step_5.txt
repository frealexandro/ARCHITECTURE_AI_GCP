**5. Test the Flow:**

Upload  `archivo_1.xlsx` to the bucket at the path `gs://bucket_experiment/`. The Cloud Function will automatically trigger, process the file, and load the data into the BigQuery table.

```bash
gsutil cp archivo_1.xlsx gs://bucket_experiment/
```

**Testing:**

* **Verify in Cloud Logging:** Review the function logs to detect errors.
* **Query the table in BigQuery:** Run an SQL query in BigQuery to verify that the data has been loaded correctly.

**Remember:**

* **Security:**  Use the principle of least privilege when granting roles to the service account.
* **Monitoring:**  Set up alerts to monitor the functioning of the data flow.

This automated data flow will allow you to efficiently process and analyze data from Excel files in Google Cloud Platform.
