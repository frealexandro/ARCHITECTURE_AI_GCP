## Information extracted from the text:

**Prerequisites:**

1. **Google Cloud Platform Account:** With an active account and a created project.
2. **Google Cloud SDK:** Installed and configured on your local machine. [https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
3. **Service accounts:** With roles that allow interaction with Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions, and BigQuery. I recommend "Storage Admin", "Cloud Functions Developer", and "BigQuery Admin" for this tutorial.
4. **Excel file:** With the data you want to load into BigQuery.

**Recommendations:**

* **File organization:** It's recommended to create folders within the bucket to organize input, output, and code files.
* **Error handling:** Implement error control in your Python code to log errors in Cloud Logging.
* **Testing:** Perform unit and integration tests to validate the correct functioning of the data flow.

**Possible errors:**

* **Insufficient permissions:** Ensure that the service account has the necessary permissions for each service.
* **Missing dependencies:** Verify that the required Python libraries are included in the `requirements.txt` file.
* **Code errors:** Debug the Python code to identify and correct errors in logic or syntax.
* **Quota limits:** Be aware of the quota limits for Cloud Functions and BigQuery.

**Testing:**

* **Verify in Cloud Logging:** Review the function logs to detect errors.
* **Query the table in BigQuery:** Run an SQL query in BigQuery to verify that the data has been loaded correctly.
